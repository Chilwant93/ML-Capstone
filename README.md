# ML-Capstone- Handwritten Digit Recognition

This is a full project of Handwritten Digit Recognition the model built Pytorch on MNIST Dataset using Sagemaker to perform Convolutional Neural Network using Pytorch as Udacity's ML Nanodegree Capstone Project.

# Project Set Up and Installation
AWS Sagemaker studio suing Python 3 (Datascience) kernel
Download MNIST dataset 
Upload to S3 backet
Pytorch library install

# Dataset
Downloaded MNIST Dataset is provide in Datset folder. Whci his downloaded using urls:
https://ossci-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz ,
https://ossci-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz ,

# Scipt file
The **mnist.py** for hyperparameter trainingÂ operations, where we train the model numerous times with various hyperparameters and look for the optimum combination based on loss metrics.
# Training 
The trianing used the pytorch estimator with **mnist.py** script to perform the training job using Convolutional Neural Network.

# Deployemnt
The endpoint is depolyed

The matrics of the depolyed endpiont determoind the CPU usages and memory utilizations during the trining process.
