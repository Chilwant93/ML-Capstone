# ML-Capstone- Handwritten Digit Recognition

This is a full project of Handwritten Digit Recognition the model built Pytorch on MNIST Dataset using Sagemaker as Udacity's ML Nanodegree Capstone Project.

# Project Set Up and Installation
AWS Sagemaker studio suing Python 3 (Datascience) kernel
Download MNIST dataset 
Upload to S3 backet
Pytorch library install

# Dataset
Downloaded MNIST Dataset is provide in Datset folder. Whci his downloaded using urls:

# Scipt file
The **mnist.py** for hyperparameter trainingÂ operations, where we train the model numerous times with various hyperparameters and look for the optimum combination based on loss metrics.

# Deployemnt
The endpoint is depolyed
